# CMIP5_patterns
This repository contains a library of temperature and precipitation patterns generated by a least squared regression for all available CMIP5 models.

All source code used to produce these patterns is found [here](https://github.com/JGCRI/CMIP5_patterns/tree/master/SRC). Individual temperature and precipitation patterns in a .nc file are found [here](https://github.com/JGCRI/CMIP5_patterns/tree/master/DATA).
